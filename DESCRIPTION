Description: Implements the count splitting methodology from the papers "Inference after latent variable estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing data" (Neufeld et al., 2023) and "Negative binomial count splitting for single-cell RNA sequencing data" (Neufeld et al., 2023). Intended for turning a matrix of single-cell RNA sequencing counts, or similar count datasets, into independent folds that can be used for training/testing or cross validation. Requires assuming that the entries in the matrix are from a Poisson or a negative binomial distribution.
